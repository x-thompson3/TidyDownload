# TidyDownload
The Tidy Download project is to keep my file systems organized and clean (as well as keep flexing my programming muscles).

The purpose of Tidy Download and Tidy Tele (pronounced "Tell-uhh") is to move files and directories to their rightful 
place in your folder hierarchy with some simple shutil.move() calls. Tidy Tele is the most up-to-date version, and scans all files
and folders in your Downloads, Documents, Pictures, and Desktop folders.

Instructions:
Simply rename the folder or file you wish to move according to the schema "DESTINATION<<FILENAME" and run the program.
Ex.) I want to move a picture named "test123" from my Downloads folder to the folder named Selfies, which has the path 
/Users/Xander/Pictures/Pictures Of Me/Selfies/
I simply rename that picture to "Selfies<<test123", call Tidy Tele from the command line, and voila!
test123 is now at /Users/Xander/Pictures/Pictures Of Me/Selfies/test123

Feel free to clone and modify this code as much as you like, free use and all that. Drop me a line if you use it, I'd love to
hear about your experience! Thanks.
